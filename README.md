# blowfish-go

This is a very simple implementation of the Blowfish algorithm in Go Lang.

:warning: ***This should not be used in production!***

This was implemented as part of a Cryptography course in university. 

The original article with the Blowfish algorithm can be found [here](https://www.schneier.com/academic/archives/1994/09/description_of_a_new.html).
